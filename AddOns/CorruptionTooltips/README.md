What more is there to say, this is a simple tooltip addon that you can use to add the common name and rank for any applicable corruptions that apply to an item.

![Tooltip Example](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/277/951/wowscrnshot_020620_232708.jpg)

**Features:**

Icon, name and rank for all corrupted Item tooltips (characters, bags and banks).
 
Ability to show Corruption in the client language, or in English.

See options using the `/ct` command.

**Why do I need it?**

Besides making it easy to compare ranks against each other, we all know that by now, everyone is just lusting after those corruptions that are high ranked, yet it's not always obvious what spell description is what corruption. This addon simplifies that.

**Issues/Support**

Notice something that isn't right? Please raise an issue at [Github](https://github.com/suspectz/Corruption-Tooltips).

**Multilingual**

The addon comes with support for all clients, but requires translations to position alongside the Corruption stat.
